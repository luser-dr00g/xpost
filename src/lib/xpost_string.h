 *
 * An string object is 8 bytes,
 * consisting of 4 16bit fields common to all composite objects
 *   tag, type enum and flags
 *   sz, count of objects in array
 *   ent, entity number   --- nb. ents have outgrown their field: use xpost_object_get/set_ent()
 *   off, offset into allocation
 * the entity data is a "C" array of chars
 *
 * "_memory" functions require a memory file to be specified.
 * functions without "memory" select the memory file from a context, using the FBANK flag.
 * an array object with the FBANK flag properly set, is called a "banked array".
