This is a fresh start of the internals document. The older file, while conceptually correct,
had become tiresome to keep updated as the names and structure keep changing.

But the basic building blocks, the abstractions, have remained quite constant throughout.

  Xpost_Memory_File   Xpost_Object
              Xpost_Stack
              Xpost_Context
  Xpost_Array Xpost_Dict Xpost_String Xpost_Name


Memory

The ground layer is the Memory File. It can be configured to use big malloc blocks,
or to mmap temporary files, and these it suballocates. Xpost_Object describes 
the tag-union for the simple object structure and is independent of Memory File,
although specialized object types like Array and Dict /do/ depend on access to 
Memory, though the Context.

An Execution Context has 2 memories: global and local. Allocations are made into the
current memory file selected by a parameter in the context, which may be altered
with the `bool setglobal` operator. Global allocations may not contain local objects.
Local may contain global. Remember, local memory is more perishable. It is subject to
save and restore. So this rule prevents dangling links in global memory.

Inside the Memory File, at address 0, is the first of a chain of memory tables.
Each segment of the table chain is a Memory Table struct which contains several
allocation slots and a counter, and an address of the next table (or zero, if the
counter is less than the table size).

Addresses to memory occur in several definite forms, which represent several
levels of "crackng the nut". Since the base pointer to memory, in either of the malloc
or mmap configurations, will be an unsigned char *, a raw memory address is an
integer which indexes the memory array. Since the memory may move whenever it must
realloc(), this "relative" pointer is the safest analogue to an "absolute" pointer
into the memory space.

    The practical upshot is this Coding Rule for Xpost source code,
    including device operator functions:

	Do Not hold a pointer while allocating!

    Don't do it. You can get real `char*`s into memory if you want.
    It's not that difficult. The xpost_dev_* files do this. But if
    you want to keep using it, you cannot create new composite objects.
    No new arrays, strings, dicts, or growing a dict past its maxlength.
    No pushing onto stacks past their current level. Because stacks are
    segmented, too, and live in the same malloc() or mmap() block.
    No new names, because names have associated strings AND live on a stack.
    There are lines in the source commented "//recalc" that show how
    to refresh a pointer after allocating, if you really need to do that.

An index into the slots of the memory tables is called an "ent" for "entity" 
or "entry" (I never could decide; sometimes one makes more sense than the other
in a given context). The slot contains the raw address of the allocation, a field
to hold accounting data (marks for gc, upper+lower save-levels), and the length of the
allocation, and a type field which may hold an object tag as a hint to the garbage
collector. This allows the garbage collector to close files.

The postscript object contains 4 fields if it's a composite object which must
"point" to memory.

    tag
    size
    ent
    offset

In the 32bit configuration, these are 16-bits each. In the untested LARGE_OBJECT
configuration, these are 32-bits each.

The tag contains a type bitfield which identifies the kind of data (string, array,
dict, file), and the ent field (+ a few bits from the tag) is the index into
the memory tables. Another bit in the tag indicates whether this ent refers
to the global memory or local memory. Having the offset and size fields in the
object makes getinterval very cheap. Simple objects typically use a combined
ent+offset field for the payload value. So an integer object has only three
fields

     16bit tag
     16bit pad
     32bit val

Several object types with simple needs use the marktype object struct which has
three fields

     16bit tag
     16bit pad0
     32bit unsigned padw

Operator objects use .mark.padw to hold the opcode. Name objects use .mark.padw
to hold the Name Stack index.

These objects may live in memory as components of arrays and dicts (stringtype objects
cannot contain other objects; there is no way to directly access an object's
representation as a string from the Postscript level). Or they may live on stacks,
which are also in memory.

Names are implemented with a ternary search tree that maps strings to integers.
The integer is stored in the nametype object in a combined ent+offset field.
It indexes a "name string stack" which contains postscript string objects
which contain the reverse mappings. One caveat: the search tree algorithm 
assumes the string is nul-terminated. A nul byte is always added before searching
(cheaply, with alloca()) but this does mean that you cannot embed nuls in names,
even if you manually convert using `string cvn`.

Dictionaries are implemented as an open hash with N+1 slots to enable terminate-on-
null in the searching.

Names are persistant through the execution lifetime of the interpreter,
but arrays and dictionaries are subject to garbage collection and to explicit
discarding by `restore`.

Composite object constructors return objects which are marked 'executable'.
It would be wise to explicitly specify the executable/literal attribute when
creating the object. So, instead of this:

    Xpost_Object arr = xpost_array_cons(ctx, 12);

do this:

    Xpost_Object arr = xpost_object_cvx(xpost_array_cons(ctx, 12));

or, to make a non-executable object:

    Xpost_Object arr = xpost_object_cvlit(xpost_array_cons(ctx, 12));


The garbage collector currently runs on a periodic cycle, every so many allocations
from the memory file. If a useable allocation is found on the free-list, the 
gc cycle count is not incremented.

Stacks are allocated in local memory, and may grow. Preparations are in place to
shrink them as well, but this is not currently activated.


Tunable parameters.

Many of the interpreter structures were designed as "chains", ie. linked-lists,
but using "addresses" in the sense described above, rather than C pointers.
The size of each segment may be changed by adjusting the constants in the 
header files.

XPOST_MEMORY_TABLE_SIZE  xpost_memory.h
XPOST_STACK_SEGMENT_SIZE xpost_stack.h

Since allocations retain their size, there is a parameter to control how
much "wastage" is permissible from a re-used allocation, which is the
ratio of the two integers:

XPOST_FREE_ACCEPT_OVERSIZE  xpost_free.h
XPOST_FREE_ACCEPT_DENOM

The garbage collector cycle is controlled by the parameter

XPOST_GARBAGE_COLLECTION_PERIOD

but it ought to be

XPOST_GARBAGE_COLLECTION_THRESHOLD

and measure allocated bytes, as described in the PLRM 2ed and 3ed.


Matrices

For ease of implementation, the postscript matrix [a b c d e f]
is treated internally as the transpose of the diagrams in the PLRM.
This produces identical results, while permitting the more C-friendly
syntax of right-multiplying matrices. Whereas Postscript's model of
left-multiplying is more appropriate for its reverse-polish syntax.

    PS> currentpoint currentmatrix transform  % --> "device"currentpoint
    PS> currentmatrix matrix invertmatrix transform  % --> currentpoint 

whereas ... um. bad example. I don't have a C equivalent to illustrate
how internally it's the reverse, but the same. You had to be there. :)


Logging

The logging system, implemented by Vincent Torri, is controlled by
the environment variable XPOST_LOG_LEVEL with an integer code,
meaning:

XPOST_LOG_LEVEL_ERR  0
XPOST_LOG_LEVEL_WARN 1
XPOST_LOG_LEVEL_INFO 2
XPOST_LOG_LEVEL_DBG  3

For debugging, the DBG level, of course is very helpful. But it
may be necessary to redirect output to an external file, possibly
with `tee`. There is a lot of output.
Enabling the TRACE variable, which may be done dynamically in gdb
with `set var TRACE=1`, writes the trace statements to the filename
announced at program startup. This output may be captured in another
terminal using `tail -F`.

[I'm learning more about pty's and investigating how to open a 
dedicated error window. But this won't really work in the library,
I think. Another option is to set the trace file from the command-line
options. And a separate mechanism for the api, I suppose.]

Operators

The operator object uses a combined ent+offset field to index
an operator table, which lives in global vm. The optab is populated
at init() by `struct oper` objects which contain a an array of
type signatures and associated function pointers. The signatures
are matched against the objects on the stack and for the first
matching signature, the associated function pointer is called.
The C operator function receives all of its declared (via signature)
operands as normal function arguments, using C hackery which abuses
the `switch` statement, and unprototyped function pointers.

Systemdict Operators.

At the same time the optab is populated with `struct oper`s, 
the systemdict is populated with the operator's name and 
a postscript-level operator object. Each xpost_op_*.c file
implements a different functional group of operators.

Devices

A Device is much like systemdict, it is a dictionary of name->operator
pairs. There are 2 "base classes", implemented entirely in postscript,
which can be sub-classed, overriding as many operators as desired,
in order to capture graphical output or optimize graphical throughput.

Here is the base class for 8bit gray-scale output. RGB differs only 
in the number of `val` objects passed on the stack to each procedure.

From the data/pgmimage.ps file:

% PGMIMAGE device handles 8bit images.
%
% It uses the full range 0-255 of values and does not calculate
% the actual maximum value in the data before transmitting. MaxVal
% is always 255.
%
% In the list of procedures below, PGMIMAGE is the Class dictionary,
% IMAGE is an instance returned by Create.
%
% procedures:
%           width height PGMIMAGE  Create  ->  IMAGE
                    creates an internal data structure for a widthXheight image

%                   val x y IMAGE  PutPix  ->  -
                    set the color value of a single pixel

%                       x y IMAGE  GetPix  ->  val
                    currently not implemented in window devices

%           val x1 y1 x2 y2 IMAGE  DrawLine  ->  -
                    calls PutPix in a Bresenham-DDA line including endpoints
                    used as a special case when drawing 0.0 .. 1.0 pixel lines
                    used by FillRect and FillPoly for each scanline

%      val x y width height IMAGE  DrawRect  ->  -
                    not used by postscript graphics

%      val x y width height IMAGE  FillRect  ->  -
                    calls DrawLine for each scanline

%               val polygon IMAGE  FillPoly  ->  -
                    calls DrawLine for each scanline

%                           IMAGE  Emit  ->  -
                    output ascii PGM file

% eg:
% PS> /dev 40 20 newPGMIMAGEdevice def
% PS> 55 1 1 38 17 dev dup /DrawLine get exec
% PS> 77 9 14 3 3 dev dup /FillRect get exec
% PS> dev dup /Emit get exec

For the minimal work to get the graphics data at the C level,
you can override the /Emit member of the derived class, but
you must create an ImgData member for the device dictionary
which is an array of arrays (rows) of integers (columns)
for the base-class's procedures to store the pixel values of
the raster image. 

Another option to get the graphics data in C, is to override
the PutPixel method. The C function will receive a call
with pixel values for each pixel.

The xcb device (and similarly for the win32 device, depending
on availability detected by `./configure`) is hard-patched
into the initialization procedures and installs two operators
into systemdict: loadxcbdevice() and loadxcbdevicecont().
The loading is divided into two C functions, so we can call
into postscript and then back again. We use postscript to handle
invoking the base class /Create method, and then modifying the
Device object and re-using that as a new class, the xcbdevice class.

http://code.google.com/p/xpost/source/browse/src/bin/xpost_dev_xcb.c

loadxcbdevicecont() is responsible for overriding the Postscript
procedures with new operator functions.

The Create operator is also divided into _create() and _create_cont().
Again, this is so it may call the base class's create method whether
it is a postscript procedure or a C function (postscript operator).

The xpost_dev_xcb.c:_create_cont() operator function actually
creates the window and maps it. Then for speed, it overrides all
of the drawing methods: PutPix, DrawLine, FillRect, and FillPoly.
(FillPoly is also overrided in the base class with a C function,
so my previous assertions of "improving throughput" by overriding
more device member functions are less compelling.)

A device may (but is not required to) implement a /Flush method
which should flush any buffered drawing operations and syncronize
the output with the execution of the postscript program.

Currently only a single running device is supported as it requires
constant attention by the main loop of the interpreter in the 
form of the event-handler function. For multiple devices, we
will need to have a list of active window devices which need
event-handling. Composable "NeWS" canvases, I suppose need to be
implemented internally. Since we can't really depend on fancy
opacity effects from the environment, I think.

The BGR device

The bgr device is intended for use when xpost is a library component
of another program. It can make use of configuration options from
the call to xpost_create() to return the image buffer to the calling
program, as well as controlling the behavior of the `showpage`
operator.

For interactive use, showpage flushes the drawing to the window
and reads a line from the keyboard (waits for the Enter key).
For library use, it may instruct showpage to `quit` the interpreter
which will return control back to the caller. If it all works right,
the caller will then have access to the raster image data.
